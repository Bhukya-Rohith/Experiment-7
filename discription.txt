The project demonstrates a React component-based UI for displaying products.

A Card component is created to show individual product details like name, price, and status.

The Card is styled using Card.css with borders, padding, and fixed dimensions.

A ProductCard component serves as the main container for multiple cards.

It imports and uses the Card component three times for different products.

ProductCard.css adds styling for layout, centering, and flexbox alignment.

The .flex-box class arranges product cards in a row with spacing and wrapping.

The appâ€™s entry point is main.jsx, which renders the ProductCard component.

The design separates presentation (CSS) and logic (JSX) for clean structure.

Overall, the project is a mini product catalog UI showcasing component reusability, props, and styling in React.
